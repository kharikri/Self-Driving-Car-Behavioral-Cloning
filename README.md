# SelfDrivingCar-BehavioralCloning

This is the third project in the Self Driving Car Nanodegree course offered by Udacity.

In this project good driving behavior is taught to an autonomous car on a simulator track. First lot of good driving data (camera images of the road and steering angle) is collected and a model is trained with convolutional neural networks. Then the trained model is used on a test track to see if a car can drive autonomously. Please see this [report](https://github.com/kharikri/SelfDrivingCar-BehavioralCloning/blob/master/writeup_report.md) for the approach taken to implement this project.

I implemented this project in Python, Keras, and OpenCV on a quad-core CPU machine.
